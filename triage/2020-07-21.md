# 2020-07-21 Triage Log

See the [README](README.md) for details on how this log was gathered.

This week was a disaster, perf-wise. 28 revisions checked. At least 7
regressions, several of them ranging from large to huge, many in rollups. Some
additional regressions may have occurred in rollups that were masked by other
regressions/improvements. 3 improvements, one of which was a reversion of a
regression. Unpicking all this is going to take days and I'm not confident
we'll actually identify every regression.

In better news, rustdoc performance is now being benchmarked, thanks to the
efforts of [Joshua Nelson](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/675).

  Up to 44.8% instruction increases on many benchmarks, and 5-10% max-rss increases on many benchmarks. I have requested it be reverted.

  Up to 10.2% losses on many benchmarks. Unclear which PR is responsible.
- [Support const args in type dependent paths (Take 2) #74113](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74113#issuecomment-661470398)

  Up to 1.5% losses on numerous benchmarks, which was expected.
- [Reduce the amount of interning and `layout_of` calls in const eval. #74202](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74202#issuecomment-661475728)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=4cd0ee9343da86d9770bf0a514a682d240e0dce8&end=125c58caebc67c32ec45ac6c0581b596fd532082&stat=instructions:u)):

- [Rollup of 9 pull requests #74543](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74543#issuecomment-661507295)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2c21a6f3a8b1c75c444b87fde5116853383b3fbd&end=891e6fee572009ff2be4d4057fb33483610c36a7&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 12% losses on rustdoc for many benchmarks.
- [Rollup of 4 pull requests #74518](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74518#issuecomment-661498214)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=48036804d2bc461b243c5d291b850e44bcca68ef&end=d7f94516345a36ddfcd68cbdf1df835d356795c3&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 6.4% losses on rustdoc for two benchmarks.

Improvements
- [Rollup of 7 pull requests #74493](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74493#issuecomment-661521298)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1fa54ad9680cc82e7301f8ed4e9b7402dfd6ce0e&end=0701419e96d94e5493c7ebfcecb66511ab0aa778&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 33.5% improvements, at least partly due to the backout of
  [#74416](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74416) in
  [#74478](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74478), but it's also
  possible that another PR in that rollup [caused a regression that was masked
  by the improvement from the backout](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74493#issuecomment-661521298).
- [Change `SymbolName::name` to a `&str`. #74214](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74214#issuecomment-661459141)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=c714eae0e3b4ba263c193d54f6e46bb9a1feb2cc&end=d9e8d6290745a65025a3e082aea72fbe372292c6&stat=instructions:u)):
  Up to 2.5% wins on numerous benchmarks.
- [Don't run `everybody_loops` for rustdoc; instead ignore resolution errors #73566](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73566#issuecomment-661484787)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=6ee1b62c811a6eb68d6db6dfb91f66a49956749b&end=5c9e5df3a097e094641f16dab501ab1c4da10e9f&stat=instructions:u)):
  Wins of up to 62.6% and losses of up to 8.5%, all on rustdoc builds. Overall,
  the improvements greatly outweigh the losses. (Landed in rollup
  [#74408](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74408).)
