Some bustage involving Cargo meant that some merges in this period didn't get
measured.

Regressions
- [Rollup of 10 pull requests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73367)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=ce6d3a73b514e9649e57cee812ad129bb2112016&end=d4ecf31efc2309fb6df8c2a8af9aaf8176ab1c8d&stat=instructions:u)):
  Regressed up to 3.5% on multiple benchmarks. Maybe
  [#71824](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71824) is the cause?
- [Disable the `SimplifyArmIdentity` pass](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73262)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7c78a5f97de07a185eebae5a5de436c80d8ba9d4&end=f4fbb93113aa4f0a0cd08e74afb35381bbfbc7f0&stat=instructions:u)):
  A small regression on a couple of benchmarks from disabling a buggy pass,
  which may be re-enabled in the future?
- A small regression occurred for `syn-opt`, but I can't tell which PR was
  responsible because the improvement occurred in one of the merges that wasn't
  measured due to the Cargo bustage.

Improvements
- Some huge improvements occurred for `clap-rs-opt`, but I can't tell which PR
  was responsible because the improvement occurred in one of the merges that
  wasn't measured due to the Cargo bustage.
- [Rollup of 8 pull requests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73316)
  ([instructions](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=1fb612bd15bb3ef098fd24c20d0727de573b4410&end=06e47688bf15d0215edbe05b21603062f6d2eb5d&stat=instructions:u)):
  A small improvement on `many-assoc-items`, and a tiny regression on a couple
  of other benchmarks.

  A small regression in debug builds due to LLVM. Pulling in [this LLVM
  change](https://reviews.llvm.org/D80964) may fix it.
